# Contribution Guidelines

Thanks for considering helping out! This list is still growing to do and we are open to suggestions for new items and categories. 
I encourage you to open a Pull Request with the change you'd like to make.

We are focused on **Social Enterprises** as a _business structure_. This means less content about individuals and more about organizations. 
However, it's not easy to draw a concrete distinction so if you're not sure just ask!

## Specifics
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Link additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category unless a category is chronological.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.
- Ensure the "status" check on your PR is passing.


If you have something great to add but no GitHub account you can reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RayScript).
