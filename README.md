  <summary>Rant on why I made this</summary>
  
  When I was at Eckerd College I repeatedly bumped into the concept of social enterprises. First, in a course called _Technology, Society, and The Environment_, then through meeting the CTO of a social enterprise, and finally by taking a course called _Social Entrepreneurship_. Each step along the way I fell more in love with the concept of social enterprises. However, I never felt like there was an easy way to connect to the world of social enterprises. 
  
  Eventually, I set a [Google Alert](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/4815696?hl=en) for weekly digests of anything related to "social entrepreneurs." That worked okay but I still felt like I was missing out on something. Fast-forward a few years and I find myself heavily involved in a nonprofit called [hackNY](https://hackny.org/), working at The New York Times, and having a stronger urge than ever to learn about social enterprises. As such, I've started compiling this list of resources to make it easy for people to connect with the world of social enterprises. See the FAQs at the bottom for some common questions.
